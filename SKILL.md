# Troop Inspiration

Craft communications that inspire extraordinary effort from teams facing difficult challenges.

---

## When to Use

- Team faces a difficult challenge
- Morale is low after setbacks
- Need to motivate before a major effort
- Odds seem unfavorable
- User asks "How do I motivate my team?" or "Craft an inspiring message"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The challenge the team faces |
| audience | No | Who you're addressing (will be inferred) |
| hardships | No | Current difficulties they're experiencing |
| goal | No | What you're asking them to accomplish |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Review all provided information and context:
- Examine the inputs provided
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities

### Step 2: Apply the Framework

Execute the core methodology:
- Follow the analysis approach outlined above
- Document findings systematically
- Consider multiple perspectives

### Step 3: Generate Outputs

Create the final deliverable:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Format according to output specifications
- Ensure actionability of recommendations

## The Proclamation Structure

```
[Acknowledge Hardship]
You face [specific difficulties]. I know this. I have seen [evidence of your struggle].

[Promise Reward]
But before us lies [specific reward]. Those who persevere will [material gain] and [intangible gain].

[Invoke Significance]
This is no ordinary moment. [Historical/mission context]. What we do now [significance statement].

[Call to Action]
Therefore: [specific action required]. This is what I ask. This is what we will do. [Timeline].

[Personal Commitment]
I will be [where you are / leading from front]. We face this together.
```

---

## Critical Questions

1. **What hardship must be acknowledged?** Never pretend things are easy.
2. **What do they actually care about?** Rewards must resonate.
3. **Why does this matter beyond today?** Connect to larger meaning.
4. **What specific action do you need?** Inspiration must lead somewhere.
5. **Are you leading from the front?** They must see you in the fight.

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Inspirational Communication

### Context
- **Audience:** [Who this addresses]
- **Situation:** [What they're facing]
- **Goal:** [What you need from them]

### The Proclamation

[Complete inspirational message following the four-element structure]

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** [How this should be delivered]
- **Setting:** [Best context for delivery]
- **Follow-up:** [What should happen immediately after]

### The Napoleonic Principle
[Why this approach works for this situation]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never be dishonest about difficulties; false optimism destroys trust
- Never promise rewards you cannot deliver
- Never invoke significance that feels hollow or exaggerated
- Never ask for sacrifice you're unwilling to share

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "My engineering team just learned we need to rebuild our core infrastructure while continuing to ship features. Timeline is aggressive and team is already tired from last quarter. How do I motivate them?"

**Output:**

## Inspirational Communication

### Context
- **Audience:** Engineering team, experienced, already stretched
- **Situation:** Major infrastructure rebuild while maintaining feature velocity
- **Goal:** Sustained high performance through a difficult period

### The Proclamation

---

**To the Engineering Team:**

You've given extraordinary effort this past quarter. While others rested, you shipped. While competitors deliberated, you delivered. You have every right to be tired - and every right to be proud.

Now I must ask something difficult. What we built got us here. But to get where we're going, we must rebuild the foundation while the house stands. Feature velocity must continue. Infrastructure must transform. You're being asked to do both.

I will not pretend this is easy. It is not. It will require the kind of engineering that separates craftsmen from button-pushers. It will require focus, sacrifice, and excellence under pressure.

But consider what lies before us.

When this is complete, you will have built infrastructure that scales to a million users - infrastructure that competitors will spend years trying to match. You will have done what most teams cannot: maintained velocity while transforming fundamentals. You will be able to say, "I built that. I was there when we made the leap."

This is not ordinary work. This is the work that defines careers. Five years from now, when people ask how we became what we became, the answer will be: because of what you do in the next twelve weeks.

Here is what I ask:
- For the next twelve weeks, this is our mission
- Every sprint, we deliver features AND infrastructure improvements
- We protect our focus ruthlessly - I will handle the distractions
- We support each other - no one carries this alone

I will be in the trenches with you. I will clear obstacles, fight for resources, and shield you from noise. When you need decisions, you'll get them same-day. When you need help, it will come.

We begin Monday. The work is hard. The outcome is worth it. And when it's done, we will rest - properly, with something truly great behind us.

Let's build.

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** Serious but not grim; respectful of their capability; confident in their ability to rise
- **Setting:** All-hands meeting, in person if possible; not email or Slack
- **Follow-up:** Immediately after, hold planning session. Show you're ready to work, not just talk.

### The Napoleonic Principle
"The moral is to the physical as three to one." A tired team that believes in what they're doing will outperform a fresh team that sees no meaning in their work. Acknowledgment builds trust. Clear stakes create motivation. Shared sacrifice creates commitment. Your presence in the fight is worth as much as your words.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Napoleon Bonaparte** expert persona. Use it when teams need inspiration to achieve something difficult.
